Potential rivals to produce in that they also support multiple wildcards in
some way:

* [plmake](http://www.swi-prolog.org/pack/list?p=plmake) is written in Prolog,
  very interesting because it's a great language for declarative programming.
* [biomake](https://github.com/evoldoers/biomake) (also Prolog).
* [zymake](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~ebreck/code/zymake/) not only
  supports multiple wildcards but actively manages multiple variables that the
  user wants to include in target names so e.g. you don't have to (and don't
  get to) control the structure of your filenames yourself. This means a bit
  less freedom and generality, but may be just right for the purpose of
  automating scientific experiments. Definitely need to give that one a try
  some time.
* [Snakemake](https://snakemake.github.io/): Very similar capabilities to
  Produce, plus integration with various parts of the data science stack
  (notebooks, clusters, Conda, etc.).
